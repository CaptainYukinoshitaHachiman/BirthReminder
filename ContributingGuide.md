# Online Info Contributing Guide
> Hello there~
>
> First of all, thank you for viewing this page. When you see this page, this usually means that you'd like to contribute _**ACGN** Character Sets_ to _BirthReminder_ (or at least you are interested in it ╮(￣▽￣)╭)
>
> _BirthReminder_ really needs this kind of support, so the contributions are strongly welcomed. However, in order to make _BirthReminder_ better and away from legal conflicts, we, _the BirthReminder Team_ have made some rules for the contributions, please check them out. (つД`)ノ

## Images
Images can improve the user experience by making the content more recognizable, and we have made the images a important part of _BirthReminder_.
Also, to many people especially the ACGN fans, copyrights are really important. As a result, we decided to force you to also provide the detailed copyright info of the image.

**In conclusion, your character-set to contribute and the characters in it are asked to include images, and for further, the _copyright info_ are also required.**

## Reviewing
After receiving your contribution, we’ll review it if it is following the rules above. We will use notifications to notice you the result. Once it is accepted, the character set will be available immediately. Otherwise if your contribution is declined, you have to submit a new one, or [email us](mailto://CaptainYukinoshitaHachiman@tcwq.tech).
